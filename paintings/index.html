				<img src="/TYstatic//img/painting1.png" alt=" EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF SAINT HORTUS (CONVERSATION ON THE PSYCHEDELIC LAWN) by Allyson Paty The gods turn up the sun, make it huge, hot-pink in the black-hatched sky. Hortus, scrawny sprite, appears thrice on ascent through the ornamental trees: sitting now on a bough, now swinging, now perched up top for a word: “O, Sun, I climb toward you from the golden below to wash in the leaves your light most haunts and go a little spectral in devotion. I no longer know, does the garden rise in health or radiation? See the hornbeam trees’ Singaporean heights, how lately their shadows turn color, get up, and roam. Moreover, my friend—see there? down on the ground?— sprouted fawn legs and can’t but sweetly recline…” The sun’s twin heads come out to lay their flesh ever so gently over the sky. One draws a solid wind, slides Hortus (not by choice) to the grass in safety, one gives a light so bright it makes all the world see-through. In chorus: “Glow contingent, Hortus. Leak. Peer into anything—stone, your friend, the air— each overlays another. Like so, I drape my hand.”">

Night in a Foreign Land by Minwhee Lee Open the window, time starts to flow. As I remember it, anyway. Neighbors, one after another, close the window; Then, with courage, I undo my latch And let the intimate, sharp wind in— Today is a lie; I wish it were.

Viscous ennui, dust-laden dark, I erase them for a moment with a larger darkness. I pick my words, one by one, In this cleaned and cooled room— You might as well come by.

How irresponsible, how safe the dreams are. The hope, the wait, ethical only in dreams. My friends who came—their faces are already the same as mine. The red books on the shelves have blackened, they do not speak. Gathered in a black room, like prisoners, we do not speak.

We are already ourselves so ‘we’ is a tautology. No need to apologize; We all know as much. Hence the way home is one of sorrow. Goodbye— I close the window.

異邦의 밤

창을 열면 시간이 흐른다. 내 기억에 따르면 그렇다. 이웃들 하나 둘 창을 닫으면 용기를 내어 빗장을 풀고 다정하게 날 선 바람이 들어오면 오늘은 거짓이다 그랬으면 좋겠다

눅진하게 들러붙은 권태를 먼지 쌓인 어둠을 더 큰 어둠으로 잠시 지우고 주섬주섬 말을 고르면 깨끗하고 서늘해진 이 방에 너희들이 찾아올 수도 있겠다

꿈이란 얼마나 무책임하고 안전한가 희망은 기다림은 꿈 속에서만 윤리적이다 도착한 친구들의 얼굴은 어느새 내 얼굴과 같고 책장의 붉은 책들은 검어진 채로 말이 없다 우리는 검은 방에 모여서 죄수처럼 말이 없다

우리가 우리라서 우리는 동어반복이고 미안하다고 말할 필요가 없어서 그 정도는 다들 알고 있어서 집에 가는 길이 서럽겠지 안녕 나는 창을 닫는다

The birds by Jenny Odell The birds are being welcomed by soft, bright human friends. Perhaps they’ve returned from a long migration. One gets the sense that they are much loved – the humans are embracing them and bringing their faces near, checking to see how they’re doing. Against the pastel sky, the birds are a velvety dark blue and each one is as big as a boat. Indeed, they might be appreciated not just as friends but as conveyances, since at least one person is casually seated on an obliging bird friend. Another person turns and beckons to others in the distance, where more bright figures are arriving in a line, pilgrimage-like, to greet the birds. Though it’s impossible to read the expression on the birds’ dark faces – as it is with all birds – their unruffled acquiescence suggests that this is a happy reunion for bird and human alike. jennyodell.com">
