The birds by Jenny Odell The birds are being welcomed by soft, bright human friends. Perhaps they’ve returned from a long migration. One gets the sense that they are much loved – the humans are embracing them and bringing their faces near, checking to see how they’re doing. Against the pastel sky, the birds are a velvety dark blue and each one is as big as a boat. Indeed, they might be appreciated not just as friends but as conveyances, since at least one person is casually seated on an obliging bird friend. Another person turns and beckons to others in the distance, where more bright figures are arriving in a line, pilgrimage-like, to greet the birds. Though it’s impossible to read the expression on the birds’ dark faces – as it is with all birds – their unruffled acquiescence suggests that this is a happy reunion for bird and human alike. jennyodell.com">
