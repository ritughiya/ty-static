Ludwig Wittgenstein writes at the end of the Tractatus that the comprehending reader “must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.” Wittgenstein’s ladder, along with a small staircase of four steps and a connected series of ramps are all thrown away here, small rectilinear forms in space. <!--more--> Paint has otherwise been applied in smooth rotations, some of it — of day and thin cloud — placed atop broader strokes — of night and its hard, abrupt pathways. Smoothed bristles are felt everywhere. In a few places, the paint has narrowly dripped down, following gravity’s desire, a force that also must be gripping the discarded ladder.">
