	<img class="painting-container painting-detail-container " src="/ty-static/img/painting1.png" alt=" EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF SAINT HORTUS (CONVERSATION ON THE PSYCHEDELIC LAWN) by Allyson Paty The gods turn up the sun, make it huge, hot-pink in the black-hatched sky. Hortus, scrawny sprite, appears thrice on ascent through the ornamental trees: sitting now on a bough, now swinging, now perched up top for a word: “O, Sun, I climb toward you from the golden below to wash in the leaves your light most haunts and go a little spectral in devotion. I no longer know, does the garden rise in health or radiation? See the hornbeam trees’ Singaporean heights, how lately their shadows turn color, get up, and roam. Moreover, my friend—see there? down on the ground?— sprouted fawn legs and can’t but sweetly recline…” The sun’s twin heads come out to lay their flesh ever so gently over the sky. One draws a solid wind, slides Hortus (not by choice) to the grass in safety, one gives a light so bright it makes all the world see-through. In chorus: “Glow contingent, Hortus. Leak. Peer into anything—stone, your friend, the air— each overlays another. Like so, I drape my hand.”">
