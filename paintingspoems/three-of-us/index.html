The music was loud and there were not enough places to sit so everyone started to just lay down on the floor. I stumbled upon you within a circle of blank faces listening to someone tell a somber story, we could tell from the mood. But watching your face there, watching your eyes, you looked like someone on the cusp of change. And I loved you so much, I loved you objectively, the way we know by instinct to love every hero at the beginning of their adventure.</h3>
